## Todo App

https://a4-cpconsiglio.onrender.com/login

This submission is actually almost the same as assignment 3, as I did almost all of these requirements for the previous assignment by choice. The application is to be a todo list web app which ties stored tasks to registered users stored in a database. It uses MongoDB, Express, and React to accomplish this. I used Bootstrap as a styling framework and incorporated Github Passport authentication in addition to local Passport authentication.
